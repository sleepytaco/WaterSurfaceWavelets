# Water Surface Wavelets

C++ implementation of the Water Surface Wavelets paper by Nvidia. 

Here is what our final result looks like:

This demonstrates implementations of the core water surface simulation algorithm (advection + height field), diffusion, procedurally generated terrain, solid-fluid coupling, and wind simulation that changes direction and intensity periodically.

## Controls

Mouse/WASD for camera movement

C to toggle orbit mode

Arrow keys to control boat

T to toggle wind
